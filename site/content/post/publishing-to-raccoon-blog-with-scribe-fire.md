I am pretty picky when it comes to my HTML. OK, a lot picky. Needless to say I don't care for WYSIWYG HTML editors.  Why are you adding extra paragraph tags everywhere? No, I put that blockquote inside that paragraph for a reason. And so on.

The one that [RaccoonBlog](http://github.com/ayende/RaccoonBlog) comes with is no different. When I go into <q>source mode</q> I expect it to not touch my source. Not cool man!

Took a bit of searching, but I finally landed on [Scribe Fire](http://www.scribefire.com). Runs right in your browser! It works just fine with the [MetaWeblog Api](http://xmlrpc.scripting.com/metaWeblogApi.html). You can tell it's dated because who the hell calls them weblogs nowadays? Plus it gets bonus points for letting you write using Markdown.

If you're seeing this post it means I am happy with it.
