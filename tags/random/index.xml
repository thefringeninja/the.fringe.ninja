Nathaniel Jones recently posted a blog on his experiences with Azure. Unfortunately he had a pretty bad experience.
I checked, and all of my azure sites were down. I logged into the portal, and discovered that all of my databases, backups, instances, and websites had been terminated and deleted. There was nothing left. In fact, everything had been deleted at midnight, 8 hours prior to the first (and only) notification of the action taken.</description></item><item><title>Value Object Only Domains</title><link>https://the.fringe.ninja/2013/10/09/value-object-only-domains/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Oct 2013 23:12:28 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://the.fringe.ninja/2013/10/09/value-object-only-domains/</guid><description>Word on the street is value objects have been getting the short stick in DDD ORMS. That&amp;rsquo;s too bad. Value objects should be first class citizens because like aggregates their role is to enforce invariants. e.g.
DateTime.Parse(&amp;#34;NOPE&amp;#34;) // &amp;lt;-- nope DateTime.TryParse(&amp;#34;NOPE&amp;#34;, out date) // &amp;lt;-- still nope What about something like an address? Is a part of your core domain &amp;lsquo;validate this address?&amp;rsquo; Or can you delegate to a generic domain, and implement with SmartyStreets or Melissa Data?</description></item></channel></rss>
