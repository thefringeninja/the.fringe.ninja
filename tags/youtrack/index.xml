Now we&amp;rsquo;re going to make it more RESTful - i.e. we will display the error page to the user agent and include the exception report form on that page.
We will do this by leveraging Nancy&amp;rsquo;s status code handling features. This will allow us to intercept any status code we want and modify the response.</description></item><item><title>Automatic Exception Reporting with YouTrack and Nancy pt. 1: The Skeleton</title><link>https://the.fringe.ninja/2013/06/06/automatic-exception-reporting-with-youtrack-and-nancy-pt.-1-the-skeleton/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Jun 2013 11:25:56 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://the.fringe.ninja/2013/06/06/automatic-exception-reporting-with-youtrack-and-nancy-pt.-1-the-skeleton/</guid><description>Getting the business users to try and recreate a bug is difficult to say the least. They may not remember what it is they did to reproduce. But you can bet that if you don&amp;rsquo;t fix it by yesterday you&amp;rsquo;re gonna get an earful. In fact we just did. This is me doing something about it :)
Turns out this is annoyingly easy with Nancy and the YouTrackSharp library, so easy that I&amp;rsquo;m not going to bother test driving this.</description></item><item><title>Displaying the Current Sprint in YouTrack for Your Boss</title><link>https://the.fringe.ninja/2013/06/05/displaying-the-current-sprint-in-youtrack-for-your-boss/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jun 2013 14:56:05 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://the.fringe.ninja/2013/06/05/displaying-the-current-sprint-in-youtrack-for-your-boss/</guid><description>Here where I work we use YouTrack for issue tracking. We have a small team, it&amp;rsquo;s easy to use and free.
We&amp;rsquo;re also trying to get the business side more involved with what we&amp;rsquo;re doing - to know that we&amp;rsquo;re not just talking to ourselves / the keyboard all day. Unfortunately the default search leaves much to be desired.
Really what I want to show is all current features without subtasks (too noisy) AND any &amp;lsquo;orphaned&amp;rsquo; tasks, bugs etc.</description></item></channel></rss>
