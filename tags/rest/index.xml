I&amp;rsquo;m as guilty of this as anyone. :) Now that HTTP is becoming the most popular protocol inside the enterprise, sending bad data across the wire becomes much easier. A hidden input field is not all that hidden.
Let&amp;rsquo;s take everyone&amp;rsquo;s second favorite fake business problem: Enrolling Students in Classes. Let&amp;rsquo;s take it further and say we want to develop this as a SaaS product.</description></item><item><title>The Wrong Way to Use Javascript</title><link>https://the.fringe.ninja/2013/12/27/the-wrong-way-to-use-javascript/</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 Dec 2013 11:06:21 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://the.fringe.ninja/2013/12/27/the-wrong-way-to-use-javascript/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been taking a bit of a coding vacation. Before I jump back into things, I decided to do a little housekeeping and clean the cobwebs from my interwebs. Specifically, reducing the level of annoying coming out of Facebook.
Look at this nonsense right here:
Wow, what a great user experience! Having to un-check 60-odd check-boxes individually is just great. I&amp;rsquo;m sure the team of 15 out of 1,000 Facebook engineers that built this page thought this was really clever.</description></item><item><title>The Electroweak Vacuum is Eventually Consistent</title><link>https://the.fringe.ninja/2013/12/18/the-electroweak-vacuum-is-eventually-consistent/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 Dec 2013 07:24:06 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://the.fringe.ninja/2013/12/18/the-electroweak-vacuum-is-eventually-consistent/</guid><description>The fastest information can ever travel is 3*10^8 m/s - in a vacuum. It&amp;rsquo;s 2/3rds that in a copper wire. In the ideal case.

I had my suspicions but I wanted to confirm it.
So, I had him put in fiddler. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t heard of this tool, get it now. It will save you a ton of time when debugging any http issue.
Anyway, my suspicions were confirmed:</description></item></channel></rss>
